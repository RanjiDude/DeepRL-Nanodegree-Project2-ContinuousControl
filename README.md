# DeepRL-Nanodegree-Project2 (ContinuousControl)

In this project, we will train a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent to try and solve Unity's Reacher environment.

### Environment Description



In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

The task is episodic and in order to solve the environment, our agent must achieve an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Download Instructions

Here are the instructions to folllow if you'd like to try out this agent on your machine. First you'll need at least Python 3.6 installed on your system. You will also need these libraries to help run the code. Most of these can be installed using the 'pip install' command on your terminal once Python has been installed.

1. numpy - NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
1. collections - High-performance container datatypes
1. torch - PyTorch is an optimized tensor library for deep learning using GPUs and CPUs
1. unityagents - Unity Machine Learning Agents allows researchers and developers to transform games and simulations created using the Unity Editor into environments where intelligent agents can be trained using reinforcement learning, evolutionary strategies, or other machine learning methods through a simple to use Python API
1. matplotlib.pyplot - Provides a MATLAB-like plotting framework
